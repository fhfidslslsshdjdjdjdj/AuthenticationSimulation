 <h1 align="center">Authentication Simulation</h1>

<p>Create a simulation of a login system that prompts for a password and only displays a welcome message if the entered password matches a pre-defined one in the program. In case of an error, display an error message and request to re-enter the password. After 3 failed attempts, the program should output a message about an unauthorized access attempt and terminate. (For simplicity, use an integer variable in the code.)
Advanced task: Complicate the program by including a user database (login and password) and requiring not only the password but also the corresponding login to be entered.</p>
